    # Service for running Chromium browser in a container
    image: linuxserver/chromium:a4879cda-ls125

    # Define security options for the container
    security_opt:
      # For Docker Engine only, many modern gui apps need this to function on older hosts as syscalls are unknown to Docker. Chromium runs in no-sandbox test mode without it.
      - seccomp:unconfined # Enable unconfined seccomp mode for this container (optional)

    # Set environment variables for the container
    environment:
      - PUID=1000 # Set the user ID for the container process (optional)
      - PGID=1000 # Set the group ID for the container process (optional)
      - TZ=Etc/UTC # Set the timezone inside the container to UTC (optional)
      - CHROME_CLI=https://bigbeartechworld.com/ # Set a URL to be used as home page (optional)

    # Mount volumes from the host into the container
    volumes:
      - /data/chromium/config:/config
      # Map the host directory /data/chromium/config to the container's /config directory
      # This allows the container to read/write configuration files to the specified host directory

    # Expose ports from the container to the host machine
    # ports:
    #   - 3000:3000 # Map port 3000 from the container to port 3000 on the host (http)
    #   - 3001:3001 # Map port 3001 from the container to port 3001 on the host (https)

    # Set the size of the container's shared memory segment
    shm_size: "1gb" # Allocate 1 GB of shared memory (RAM) for this container

    # Define the restart policy for the container
    restart: unless-stopped
    # This means the container will automatically restart unless explicitly stopped by the user or Docker itself
